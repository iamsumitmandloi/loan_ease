# AI Usage

I used Claude Sonnet to save time on the boring stuff so I could focus on the logic.

**What AI generated:**
*   **JSON Serialization**: 
*   **Hive Adapters**: 
*   **Unit Test Mocks**:
*   **Regex Patterns**:

**What I wrote:**
*   **The Repository Logic**: 
*   **State Management**: 
*   **UI Flow**: 
*   **Error Recovery logic**:

Basically: AI was my typist, I was the architect.
